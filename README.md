# Tic-Tac-Toe---AI-Minimax-

Tic Tac Toe Game with Minimax Algorithm and Game Mode Customization

This repository contains a Tic Tac Toe game implementation in Python that utilizes the Minimax algorithm for the AI player. The game allows users to play against an AI opponent or another human player. It also offers various game mode options that users can choose based on their preferences.

Features:

Minimax Algorithm AI: The AI player uses the Minimax algorithm to make the most optimal moves and ensure a challenging gameplay experience. It explores all possible moves and outcomes to select the best move for the current state of the board.

Human vs. AI: You can choose to play against the AI as a single player. The AI's moves will be calculated using the Minimax algorithm.

PvP: You can select a two-player mode, where you can compete against another person on the board.

Customizable Game Modes: The game provides several customizable options, such as board size and win conditions, colors, etc., allowing you to create different versions of Tic Tac Toe.

Simple and User-Friendly Interface: The game interface is designed to be simple and easy to use, making a calm gaming experience for users.



Instructions:

If you want to play, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system. If you don't have them yet, you can get Python at python.org, and Pygame can be installed using pip: pip3 install pygame.

Run the game by executing python main.py in your terminal or command prompt.

The game should be up and running now. You'll have the option to choose your game mode and customize the settings.

Challenge the AI or play against your friends in PvP matches.



Game Mode Customization:

Feel like mixing things up? Customize the game mode by modifying the following settings in the main.py file:

g chnages the gamemode.
r restarts it (it will automatically restart as you playing against the AI)
0 make you play against the AII
1 makes you play against a random AI

Acknowledgments:

This awesome project takes inspiration from the classic Tic Tac Toe game and uses the powerful Minimax algorithm to create a challenging AI opponent. I've designed it with educational purposes in mind to demonstrate the implementation of the Minimax algorithm within a simple gaming scenario.
